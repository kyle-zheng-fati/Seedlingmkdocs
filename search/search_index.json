It serves as a hub of information for those motivated enough to seek out opportunities beyond the immediate. It serves as a resource of education that enriches the classes and allows for those struggling to have tailored help. Through this project, the seedlings at this school hope to grow into towering trees.</p> <p>The central idea differs from CommunityALI or the MJC site because this site is more verbose and focuses on a connection between the students and the school. As such, a \"bloggy\" type of model has been adapted into the formulation of the site. It will also be actively maintained by students and have minimal bloat and minimal bureaucratic approach.</p>"},{"location":"getstarted/","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"getstarted/#maintainers","title":"Maintainers","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Clone the repository onto your local machine</p> </li> <li> <p><code>git clone https://github.com/ImmaculateDivinity/SeedlingEducation</code></p> </li> <li> <p>This uses HTTPS which may require a different format if <code>git clone</code> is   configured with SSH</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a feature/release/patch/fix branch depending on what you are trying to    contribute and switch to that branch</p> </li> <li> <p>Install dependencies (assuming proper installation of npm and pip, and a    python virtual environment)</p> </li> <li> <p><code>npm install &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt</code> - dev-build dependencies</p> </li> <li> <p><code>pre-commit install</code> - pre-commit hooks</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically update your branch</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt; # switch to dev branch\ngit fetch origin           # update dev branch with main branch\ngit merge origin/main\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getstarted/#outside-collaborators","title":"Outside Collaborators","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Fork the repository onto your profile</p> </li> <li> <p>Clone your fork onto your local machine</p> </li> <li> <p><code>git remote add  upstream https://github.com/ImmaculateDivinity/SeedlingEducation</code></p> </li> </ol> <p>to add a remote to main repository</p> <p>Please keep your fork updated with the main repository before opening a pull request [Always pull before push]</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>git fetch upstream</code> to grab changes from the main repository.
